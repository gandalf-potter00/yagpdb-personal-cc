## Preface 
These custom commands are imported from all of the working cc's I have made. These haven't been tested to be used for other servers, but rather for my own personal use. You most likely will not find a use for these commands. This repository is simply so that I can safely export my work somewhere without worry of running out of space to write more cc's. Check out my other repositories for YAGPDB if you want cc's that are geared for servers other than my own.
