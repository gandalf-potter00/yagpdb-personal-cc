    Applies a role to a user to ban them from appeals. Also creates a log of the event. Creates a database entry to be used later (in the event a user leaves and rejoins). Additional code is necessary if you want to utilize the database entry (i.e. adding code to the join logs).
    Command usage: -appealban <user:ID/Mention> <reason:text>
